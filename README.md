`Independence`

In contrast to Homework assignments, you must work completely independently on this project – do not discuss your approach, your code, or your results with any other students, and do not use the discussion board for questions related to this project. If questions do arise, please email the instructor.

`Context`

At this point, we’ve covered Building Blocks, Data Wrangling I, Visualization and EDA, and Data Wrangling II. These three topics give a broad introduction into the commonly-used tools of data science, and are the main focus of this project.

`Due date`

Due: **October 26 at 4:00pm**.

`Reproducibility`

The course’s emphasis on workflow – especially the use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files– will be reflected in your Midterm Project submission.
